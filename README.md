> Magic to prevent refreshing package archives failure

[![Refresh](https://github.com/emacs-eask/archives/actions/workflows/refresh.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-eask/archives/actions/workflows/refresh.yml)

Workflow automatically downloads package archives and stores them here.

**NOTE:** It will refresh every `1` hour(s).

## ‚ùì Why do we need this?

When sandboxing during Emacs package development, we might need to call
`package-refresh-contents` multiple times due to the newly configured
environment. While Eask already minimizes unnecessary refreshes, you
may still encounter `404` errors from the archive servers (`elpa`,
`melpa`, etc.). This typically happens when the server temporarily
blocks your IP after too many requests within a short period. In such
cases, you‚Äôll need to wait a few minutes (depending on the server) for
your IP to be unblocked.

This is where the `archives` feature comes in! Eask helps you avoid this
situation by downloading the `archive-contents` files when a `404` is
encountered. In other words, your package refreshes will never fail. üéâ
